## My Must Do List (Personal React Project)

## Approach

This is a basic To-do-list app built on React, built as a single page application (SPA). I used it as an opportunity to brush up on the various principles of React.js, such as one-way binding. It also helped me brush up on the nuanced of state, setting state and updating state, was a great way to practice ES6 and JSX aswell. It was deployed on GitHub pages.

THis project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## Technologies Used
